# version-Control
This program uses Python to do a few things:
1. Ask you for your name and favorite number 
2. Prints your name
3. Prints the square of the number 

Below is a sample of the program running using JupyterLab.

![num = int (input (Enter your favorite number))](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114427708/194906061-3822a4ec-24aa-43a2-80b5-64a5ac260e8e.jpeg)

# Using the Program in JupyterLab
